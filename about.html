		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p>My name is Amanda Winkler. I am the creator of Winkyâ€™s World. It is my outlet for the energy whirling around inside of me. I am currently working as a front end developer. I went to school at Temple University & then to Champlain College where I received my B.S. in Web Design and Development. </p>
		<p>The vision I have for Winkyâ€™s World is for it be a safe and accepting space. It is a place where we can be ourselves and let dreams fly ðŸ™‚ It is a place of elevation and collaboration. It a place where we can fight for a better world and build the things we want to see. When we connect and open up to each other, we create more understanding in the world. I think it is magical that we have the capability to create things with our brains and determination..especially when we do it together.</p>
		<p>My goal is to leverage my interests in technology & design to connect with others and collaborate to build cool things. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to collaborate or connect!</p>
